# drug-dispensing-tool
class work 
The above is a school project that we are working on to make a drug dispensing tool. 
This means that we are looking for a way of connecting the doctor, the drug manufacturing companies, the pharmacies and the patients. 
The website will follow the requirements as written in the pdf files and this will enable creation of different user interfaces for the pharmacies, doctors and patients. 
The website should be able to access the patients location or canask for location by inputing an address so as to locate the pharmacy and the doctor nearest to them. 
This will help them locate a facility near them and maybe even ease delivery.  
The drugs will also be distibuteed according to location of different pharmacies to enable proper distibution of drugs per locality.
The requirements are as stated in the pdf files and in the pictures. 


currently at version 1, stay tuned for some cool features and updates :)
